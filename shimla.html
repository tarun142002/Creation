            <h2>About Shimla Tourism</h2>

            <p> Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and a popular hill-station among Indian families and
                honeymooners.&nbsp;Situated at the height of 2200m, Shimla was the summer capital of British India.
                Shimla still retains its old-world charm with beautiful colonial architecture, pedestrian-friendly Mall
                Road and the ridge lined up with multiple shops, cafes and restaurants.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> Shimla is well connected with many cities and is just 4 hours from the nearby city of Chandigarh. The
                city has an airport as well; however, there aren't many daily flights from here. The railway station
                connects Shimla with the plans and is famous for the Kalka-Shimla train route; a UNESCO listed World
                Heritage site.<br><br>The weather is pleasant for most of the months with tourists flocking especially
                during the summer months. The winters are cold with some days of snow from mid-December till February
                end.<br><br>Shimla is often covered along with nearby towns of Kufri, a hill-station almost always
                covered by snow and Chail, famous for a huge palace and the highest cricket ground in the world.
                Tourists also visit the famous Jakhu Temple and engage in sightseeing at various viewpoints during their
                trip to Shimla.</p>
