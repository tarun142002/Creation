                    <h3>About Leh Ladakh Tourism</h3>
                    <p>The Land of High Passes, Ladakh, the newly created Union Territory in India (previously a part of
                        Jammu &amp; Kashmir), boasts a landscape that can leave you with your jaws dropped. It is a
                        place where the landscape changes dramatically; it is truly astonishing to see the mountains,
                        snow, cold desert, alpine meadows and lakes at a short distance from each other. Tourism in
                        Ladakh is an absolute delight for nature lovers as well as adventurers.</p>
                    <p>Adorned with the lofty barren mountains, Ladakh is home to some of the highest motorable passes
                        like Khardung La (5359 m), Marsimik La (5582 m), and Chang La (5360 m), and alpine lakes like
                        Pangong Tso (4350 m) and Tso Moriri (4522 m). Ladakh is further divided into three regions -
                        Leh, Nubra, and Zanskar, and each region has several places to see.</p>
                    <p>Ladakh is majorly popular amongst the adventurers who feel welcomed by the number of adrenaline
                        rushing activities offered here. The union territory is amongst the top trekking destinations in
                        India with amazing and unmatched treks like the popular Frozen River Trek/Chadar Trek. Ladakh
                        also has opportunities for mountaineering, motor biking, mountain biking, white water rafting
                        and more. </p>
                    <p>Adding to its exceptional beauty are the ancient Buddhist monasteries that are mostly nestled
                        in the mountains and are thousands of years old. These monasteries make for the Buddhist
                        pilgrimage destinations in Ladakh and also act as important cultural centres where major
                        religious festivals take place.</p>

                        trip. Our authentic Ladakh travel guide includes information on the top places to visit,

                                </div>The easiest and best way to travel to Ladakh is to take a flight.
                                There are a number of flights flying to Ladakh during the peak season and also during
                                the offseason. But there might be changes in the flights due to the ongoing coronavirus
                                pandemic.
                                The nearest airport is Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport located in Leh. This airport is
                                just 3.8 km away from the main city.
                                Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport is well connected with many international airports in
                                India like Delhi. It also receives flights from Srinagar, Jammu, Chandigarh, and other
                                common destinations in India.

                                The scenic flight from Delhi to Leh takes one and a half hours. Even international
                                travelers can directly board a flight from the major cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, and
                                Delhi to reach Leh Airport by air and then ultimately to Ladakh. You can find a few
                                taxis outside the airport or book a cab to reach the required destination

                                <strong class="car_icon">By road:</strong>
                                <br>There are two road routes to Leh Ladakh- one through Manali in Himachal Pradesh and
                                the second one through Srinagar. Ladakh is 434 km from Srinagar and 494 km from Manali.

                                To reach Leh by road you can hire a cab or a jeep or board a JKSRTC bus, both deluxe and
                                ordinary, run from Kargil and between Leh and Srinagar on regular and frequent
                                intervals.

                                Alternatively, you can embark on a bike trip to Leh from Srinagar, Manali, Delhi or
                                Chandigarh depending upon the time you have. You can only travel to Ladakh by road
                                between May to September as during the winter months the highways are shut due to heavy
                                snowfalls.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <br> You cannot reach Ladakh directly by train as there is no train station in Ladakh.
                                The nearest railway station is Jammu Jammu Tawi (700 km from Ladakh) which is well
                                connected with Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai. You can hire a cab or board a JKSRTC bus to
                                reach Ladakh from Jammu.
